### Purpose
The main purpose of this repository is to document my journey of learning C programming. By maintaining this collection of projects, I can track my progress and revisit concepts.

### Contents
This repository contains various C projects, each residing in its own directory. Inside each project directory, you'll find the source code files along with any necessary resources or documentation specific to that project.
